Escaping Special Characters

Lucene supports escaping special characters that are part of the query syntax. The current list special characters are

	+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \

To escape these character use the \ before the character. For example to search for (1+1):2 use the query:

\(1\+1\)\:2
